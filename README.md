- 👋 Hi, I’m @aloworld
- 👀 I’m interested in C#, Swift and SwiftUI, Haskell and Python. 
-    I'm also interested in machine learning and quantum computing, learning new languages, and chess.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SwiftUI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some OpenSource projects, but not yet found a project or the time to invest on it.
- 📫 How to reach me: alo.world@gmail.com
My profile photo was taken by Fiona Steil-Antoni, when I was playing a chess tournament at Reykjavic Open 2017. I might have lost that game. And, no, I'm not a titled player (yet?).

👋 Hi, I’m @aloworld

- 👀 I’m interested in C#, Swift, Rust, and Haskell. 
-    I'm also interested in machine learning and quantum computing, learning new languages, and chess.
- 🌱 I’m currently enjoying some free time getting to know Rust and Electron.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some OpenSource projects with C#, or Rust.
- 📫 How to reach me: message me here (preferable) or write to alo.world@gmail.com

My profile photo was taken by Fiona Steil-Antoni, when I was playing a chess tournament at Reykjavic Open 2017. I might have lost that game. And, no, I am not a titled player (hopefully some day).
